The project proposes a machine learning approach to detect fake reviews in a dataset including Amazon customer reviews. The dataset contains 21,000 reviews, equally divided between real and fake reviews. Machine learning algorithms, like KNN, DNN, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, were evaluated.
